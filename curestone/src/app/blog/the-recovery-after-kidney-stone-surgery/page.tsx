              <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">Kidney stones are crystalline solid accumulations that develop in the kidney and result in acute discomfort and difficulty urinating. Surgery is required when stones are larger than normal to pass or continuously cause symptoms. A patient’s comprehension of the recovery period after stone surgery is essential to achieving the best possible outcome in healing and avoiding future incidents.</p>
              <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">Below are the different types of kidney stone removal surgeries:-</p>
              <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">1. Ureteroscopy (URS) with Laser Lithotripsy:</p>
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mb-4 mt-10">Different Types Of Kidney Stone Surgeries</h2>
              <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">Procedure: A slender scope is threaded through the urinary passage to locate and destroy stones using a laser.</p>
              <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">Recovery: Patients, in general, will be able to perform routine activities within a few days, mostly 2 or 3 days. Stents left temporarily to allow urine to flow may be mildly painful until removed. ​</p>
              <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">Procedure: Access and treatment of stones located inside the kidney are done using a flexible scope without any cuts being made.</p>
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mb-4 mt-10">2. Retrograde Intrarenal Surgery (RIRS)</h2>
              <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">Recovery: includes a short-time hospitalization — with patients being sent home the same day or post one-night stay in the hospital. Return to normal activities is assumed to happen in a few days.</p>
              <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">Procedure: A large or complex kidney stone will be removed through the back by making an incision in the body.</p>
              <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">Recovery: Hospitalization could be as short as one to two days, while full recovery will take two to four weeks. Patients should be advised that heavy lifting is prohibited during this time.</p>
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mb-4 mt-10">3. Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (PCNL)</h2>
              <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">Procedure: This is a non-invasive procedure that uses shock waves to reduce the size of the stones by breaking them into smaller fragments.</p>
              <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">Recovery: Most patients resume normal activities within two days and adequate hydration facilitates the excretion of stone fragments.</p>
              <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">The time taken for kidney stone surgery will rely on the type of procedure, the stone’s size and location, and how complex the case is. Below is a summary of the average time taken for each commonly performed procedure:</p>
